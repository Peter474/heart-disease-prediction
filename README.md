# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction - Full ML Pipeline

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline built using the **Heart Disease UCI Dataset**. It includes everything from data preprocessing to model deployment using Streamlit and Ngrok.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the heart disease dataset.
- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Perform feature selection using statistical and ML-based techniques.
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Apply unsupervised learning:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Build a Streamlit UI for live predictions.
- Deploy the model with Ngrok (bonus).
- Host the project on GitHub.
